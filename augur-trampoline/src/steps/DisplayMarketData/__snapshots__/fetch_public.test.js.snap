  YES share represents European call option on ETH with strike price $500.
  Holder of NO share becomes option writer.
  
  At the expiration holder of YES share receives the amount by which ETH exceeds price of $500.
  Holder of NO share received $500 or 1 ETH, whichever is smaller.
  
  Now you can trade Ethereum volatility on Augur :)

  Instruction for reporters:
  
  Let E be price of last trade on Coinbase Pro for pair ETH/USD in year 2018 (UTC).
  
  Calculate V = (E - $500) / E.
  
  If V < 0, resolve market as 0.
  Otherwise resolve market as V, rounded to the nearest market tick.
  
  In the unlikely event that V falls exactly in the middle between two market ticks, round up.",
